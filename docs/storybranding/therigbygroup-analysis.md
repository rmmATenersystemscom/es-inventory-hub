## 1. STORYBRAND COMPLIANCE ANALYSIS

### Current StoryBrand Performance: 7/10

Based on available information, Rigby Financial Group has a solid StoryBrand foundation but opportunities for enhancement.

#### What's Working Well

| Element | Current Strength |
|---------|------------------|
| **Clear Value Proposition** | ✅ "Insights that lead to smarter financial decisions" is outcome-focused |
| **Industry Specialization** | ✅ Six clearly defined industry focuses show expertise |
| **Customer Testimonials** | ✅ Homepage features client quotes (Dr. R., Charles C., Dr. E.) |
| **Service Clarity** | ✅ Well-organized service offerings |
| **Differentiators** | ✅ Six clear value propositions (expertise, tailored, data-driven, scalable, success, proactive) |
| **Calls to Action** | ✅ "Contact Us To Get Started" and phone number prominent |

#### StoryBrand Gaps to Address

| Framework Element | Current Issue | Needed Fix |
|------------------|---------------|------------|
| **Hero (Customer)** | Messaging balanced but could be more customer-first | Lead with: "Your business deserves better financial insights. You deserve peace of mind." |
| **Problem Statement** | Not explicitly articulated upfront | Open with: "Confused by your financials? Overpaying taxes? Wondering if your business is as profitable as it should be?" |
| **Internal Problem** | Missing emotional connection | Add: "You're stressed about money. You feel like you're flying blind financially. You worry you're leaving money on the table." |
| **Philosophical Problem** | Not clearly stated | "Entrepreneurs deserve financial clarity and expert guidance, not confusing spreadsheets and generic advice" |
| **Guide Positioning** | Authority present but empathy could be stronger | Add: "For 31 years, we've helped 500+ entrepreneurs gain financial clarity and confidence" |
| **Plan** | Not clearly visible/simple on homepage | Create 3-step plan: "1. Financial Assessment 2. Custom Strategy 3. Ongoing Partnership" |
| **Failure Stakes** | Not emphasized | "Without expert financial guidance: overpaid taxes, missed opportunities, financial stress, poor decisions cost $50K-$500K+" |
| **Success Vision** | Present but could be more vivid | "Imagine: crystal-clear financials, confident decisions, thousands saved in taxes, peace of mind about your financial future" |

   $100,000s on the table through poor pricing, inefficient operations,
   and missed growth opportunities

❌ Poor Decisions: Bad financial decisions cost businesses 10-30% of revenue
   through cash flow crises, wrong hires, poor investments, and timing mistakes

❌ Exit Disaster: Lack of planning means selling your business for 30-50%
   less than optimal value—potentially $500K-$5M+ left on the table

❌ Financial Stress: Constant worry about money, sleepless nights, strain
   on relationships, and inability to enjoy the success you've built

❌ Estate Tax Exposure: Without proper planning, high-net-worth families can
   lose 40%+ to estate taxes that could have been legally avoided

Create `/resources/financial-glossary` with 100+ terms:

**Essential Financial & Tax Terms:**

- **Adjusted Gross Income (AGI):** Total gross income minus specific deductions (above-the-line deductions like retirement contributions, HSA, self-employed health insurance). AGI determines eligibility for many tax benefits and deductions.

- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):** Direct costs attributable to producing goods or services sold. For manufacturers: materials + direct labor + factory overhead. For service businesses: direct labor + subcontractors. Gross Profit = Revenue - COGS.

- **EBITDA:** Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization. A measure of operational profitability used in business valuations. Formula: Net Income + Interest + Taxes + Depreciation + Amortization.

- **Fractional CFO:** Part-time Chief Financial Officer who provides strategic financial leadership without the cost of a full-time executive. Typically engaged 5-20 hours per week for businesses with $2M-$50M in revenue.

- **Gross Profit Margin:** Percentage of revenue remaining after Cost of Goods Sold. Formula: (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue × 100. Indicates pricing power and production efficiency. Healthy margins vary by industry: 20-30% (retail), 50-70% (software), 40-60% (professional services).

- **K-1 (Schedule K-1):** Tax form issued by partnerships, S-corporations, and some trusts showing each owner's share of income, deductions, and credits. Pass-through entities don't pay tax at entity level - income "passes through" to owners' personal returns via K-1.

- **Operating Cash Flow:** Cash generated from normal business operations, excluding financing and investing activities. Formula: Net Income + Depreciation/Amortization - Changes in Working Capital. Positive OCF indicates business generates cash to sustain operations.

- **Qualified Business Income (QBI) Deduction:** Section 199A deduction allowing eligible business owners to deduct up to 20% of qualified business income. Subject to income limitations and phase-outs. Major tax benefit for pass-through entities (S-Corp, partnership, sole proprietor).

- **Reasonable Compensation (S-Corp):** IRS requires S-Corp shareholders who work in the business to pay themselves "reasonable" W-2 wages before taking distributions. Wages subject to payroll taxes; distributions are not. Balancing wages vs. distributions is key S-Corp tax strategy.

- **Section 179 Deduction:** Immediate expensing of qualified equipment and property purchases (up to $1,160,000 in 2025) rather than depreciating over years. Must be placed in service by year-end. Phases out dollar-for-dollar after $2,890,000 in purchases.

- **S-Corporation:** Pass-through entity that avoids double taxation while providing self-employment tax savings. Income passes to shareholders via K-1. Shareholders who work in business must take reasonable W-2 compensation, then can take distributions. Saves 15.3% self-employment tax on distributions.

- **Working Capital:** Current Assets minus Current Liabilities. Measures short-term financial health and liquidity. Positive working capital means you can pay current obligations. Formula: (Cash + AR + Inventory) - (AP + Accrued Expenses).

#### 6. Q&A Format Content

**Q: How much can I really save with strategic tax planning?**

A: The answer depends on your specific situation, but the tax savings from strategic planning vs. basic compliance are substantial. Here are real-world examples:

**Example 1: Professional Services Firm ($500K profit)**
- **Before strategic planning:**
  - Sole proprietorship structure
  - No retirement plan
  - Minimal planning
  - **Tax burden: $180,000** (federal + state + SE tax)

- **After Rigby's strategic planning:**
  - S-Corporation election
  - Reasonable compensation: $120K W-2
  - Distributions: $380K (no SE tax)
  - Solo 401(k) contribution: $69,000
  - **New tax burden: $105,000**
  - **ANNUAL SAVINGS: $75,000**

**Example 2: Real Estate Investor ($2M property portfolio)**
- **Before strategic planning:**
  - No cost segregation
  - Suboptimal entity structure
  - No strategic tax planning
  - **Tax burden: $85,000 annually**

- **After Rigby's strategic planning:**
  - Cost segregation study: $450K in accelerated depreciation
  - Entity restructuring: LP + management company
  - 1031 exchange planning
  - **New tax burden: $32,000**
  - **ANNUAL SAVINGS: $53,000**
  - **Plus $180K first-year depreciation benefit from cost segregation**

**Example 3: Medical Practice ($1.2M physician income)**
- **Before:**
  - W-2 employee compensation only
  - Basic 401(k): $23K contribution
  - **Tax burden: $420,000**

- **After Rigby's planning:**
  - Practice restructure with income splitting
  - Cash balance defined benefit plan: $250K contribution
  - Additional tax strategies
  - **New tax burden: $315,000**
  - **ANNUAL SAVINGS: $105,000**

**What Drives Savings:**
1. **Entity structure optimization:** $15K-$75K+ annually
2. **Retirement plan maximization:** $10K-$100K+ in tax-deferred growth
3. **Timing strategies:** $5K-$50K by accelerating/deferring income/expenses
4. **Real estate strategies:** $20K-$200K+ (cost seg, 1031, entity structuring)
5. **Tax credits:** $10K-$100K+ (R&D, WOTC, energy)
6. **Hidden deductions:** $5K-$30K in commonly missed items

**The Reality:**
- Most business owners overpay by **30-50%** due to lack of strategic planning
- Average Rigby client saves **$50,000-$150,000 annually** in taxes
- Over a 20-year business ownership, that's **$1M-$3M+** kept vs. sent to IRS

**Investment vs. Return:**
- Strategic tax planning fee: $5,000-$15,000/year
- Average tax savings: $50,000-$150,000/year
- **ROI: 5-20x** (and that's every single year)

**But it's not just about taxes:**
The financial clarity, better decisions, and strategic guidance from having a CFO-level advisor often generates 10-100x more value through:
- Improved profitability (better pricing, cost control)
- Avoided mistakes (bad investments, wrong hires)
- Growth opportunities identified
- Better exit value (proper planning adds 30-50% to sale price)

**Bottom line:** If you're making $200K+ from your business and not working with a strategic tax advisor, you're almost certainly overpaying by $30K-$100K+ per year.
