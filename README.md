## ðŸ”„ CHECK-IN Process

### **Purpose**
The CHECK-IN process is a complete Git commit and tag workflow that preserves all changes made to the ES Inventory Hub project with comprehensive version control and documentation.

### **When to Use CHECK-IN**
- When you want to save all current changes to the project
- After completing a set of related modifications
- Before making major changes that might need to be reverted
- When you want to create a versioned snapshot of the current state

### **Usage**
To trigger the CHECK-IN process, simply run:
```bash
/opt/es-inventory-hub/scripts/checkin.sh
```

Or when working with an AI assistant, use the command:
```
CHECK-IN!
```

### **What Happens During CHECK-IN**

#### **1. Git Add**
- All changes are automatically staged for commit
- No manual `git add` commands needed

#### **2. Git Commit**
- Changes are committed with a detailed, descriptive message
- The commit message describes all modifications made

#### **3. Git Tag**
- A version tag is created with a comprehensive descriptive message
- Tag format: `vX.Y.Z` (e.g., v1.0.0, v1.1.0, v2.0.0)
- Tag message contains detailed notes about all changes

#### **4. Version Number Update**
- Updates the version number in main README.md to match the new tag
- Updates line: `**Current Version**: vX.Y.Z (stable)`
- Updates line: `## Current Version (vX.Y.Z)`

#### **5. Git Push**
- Both commit and tag are pushed to the remote repository
- Ensures all changes are backed up and available to other team members

### **Version Strategy**
- **Patch Updates**: `vX.Y.Z+1` (e.g., v1.0.0 â†’ v1.0.1) for bug fixes and minor changes
- **Minor Features**: `vX.Y+1.0` (e.g., v1.0.1 â†’ v1.1.0) for new features
- **Major Changes**: `vX+1.0.0` (e.g., v1.5.2 â†’ v2.0.0) for significant architectural changes
