## ROI CALCULATION FRAMEWORK

### The Formula

```
Annual Revenue from Website =
  (Monthly [Conversions] × 12 months)
  × [Conversion]-to-Customer Rate
  × Average [Transaction] Value
```

### How to Estimate Each Variable

#### 1. **Monthly [Conversions] from Website**

**How to estimate:**
- Current website [conversions] (if tracked): _______
- Industry benchmark: Well-optimized [industry] website = X-Y% of visitors convert
- Traffic estimate: Ranking Top 5 for [X] keywords = [X]-[Y] monthly visitors
- Conservative: [X] visitors × X% = **[X] [conversions]/month**
- Moderate: [X] visitors × X% = **[X] [conversions]/month**

**Your numbers:**
- Current monthly website visitors: _______
- Expected visitors after optimization: _______
- Realistic conversion rate: _______%
- **Your estimated monthly [conversions]: _______**

---

#### 2. **[Conversion]-to-Customer Rate**

**How to estimate:**
- Current conversion rate (if known): _______
- [Industry] benchmarks:
  - [Scenario A]: X-Y%
  - [Scenario B]: X-Y%
  - Blended average: X-Y%

**Your numbers:**
- Current conversion rate: _______%
- **Your estimated conversion rate: _______%**

---

#### 3. **Average [Transaction] Value**

**How to estimate:**
- Review last 12 months of [sales/projects/jobs]
- Calculate average
- Weight by frequency

**[Industry] Averages:**
- [Service/Product A]: $X-$Y
- [Service/Product B]: $X-$Y
- [Service/Product C]: $X-$Y
- Blended average: $X-$Y

**Your numbers:**
- Typical [type A] value: $_______
- Typical [type B] value: $_______
- Estimated mix: _______
- **Your weighted average: $_______**

---

### Example Calculations

#### Example A: Conservative Scenario

**Inputs:**
- Monthly [conversions]: [X]
- Conversion rate: X%
- Average value: $X

**Calculation:**
```
([X] [conversions]/month × 12 months) = [X] annual [conversions]
[X] × X% conversion = [X] customers
[X] customers × $X average = $X annual revenue
```

**Investment:** $X
**ROI:** $X ÷ $X = **Xx**

---

#### Example B: Moderate Scenario

**Inputs:**
- Monthly [conversions]: [X]
- Conversion rate: X%
- Average value: $X

**Calculation:**
```
([X] × 12) = [X] annual [conversions]
[X] × X% = [X] customers
[X] × $X = $X annual revenue
```

**Investment:** $X
**ROI:** $X ÷ $X = **Xx**

---

#### Example C: Aggressive Scenario

**Inputs:**
- Monthly [conversions]: [X]
- Conversion rate: X%
- Average value: $X

**Calculation:**
```
([X] × 12) = [X] annual [conversions]
[X] × X% = [X] customers
[X] × $X = $X annual revenue
```

**Investment:** $X
**ROI:** $X ÷ $X = **Xx**

---

### Your Turn: Calculate Your Potential ROI

**Step 1: Fill in your estimates**
- Expected monthly [conversions] from optimized website: _______
- Your conversion rate: _______%
- Your average value: $_______

**Step 2: Calculate annual revenue**
```
_______ [conversions]/month × 12 = _______ annual [conversions]
_______ × _____% = _______ new customers
_______ customers × $_______ average = $_______ annual revenue
```

**Step 3: Calculate ROI**
```
$_______ annual revenue ÷ $_______ investment = _______x ROI
```

### Investment Range Estimate

Based on the work outlined in this analysis:

| Item | Low End | High End |
|------|---------|----------|
| Content creation ([X] hours) | $X* | $X** |
| Schema markup & technical | $X | $X |
| Interactive tools | $X | $X |
| Video production | $X | $X |
| [Other items] | $X | $X |
| **Total First-Year Investment** | **$X** | **$X** |

*Low end assumes DIY with internal time valued at $50/hour
**High end assumes outsourced at $250/hour

**Most Realistic Range: $X-$X** (hybrid approach)

---

### Important Considerations

**This calculation assumes:**
- ✅ Content strategy is actually executed
- ✅ Content quality is high
- ✅ [Industry-specific assumption]
- ✅ [Technical assumption]
- ✅ [Capacity assumption]

**Not included in this calculation:**
- Long-term compounding value (Years 2-5)
- [Customer lifetime value/repeat business]
- Referrals from satisfied customers
- Brand reputation building
- [Industry-specific additional value]

**Timeline expectations:**
- Months 1-3: Minimal results (indexing delay)
- Months 4-6: Early traction (some rankings, first inquiries)
- Months 7-12: Accelerating results (stronger rankings, consistent inquiries)
- Year 2+: Compounding returns

---

### Breakeven Analysis

**To break even on a $X investment:**

If average [transaction] is $X:
- Need [X] new customers ($X ÷ $X = [X] customers)

If conversion rate is X%:
- Need [X] [conversions] ([X] × X% = [X] customers)

**Bottom line:** If website generates just [X] qualified [conversions] over 12 months, you'll likely break even. Everything beyond that is profit.
