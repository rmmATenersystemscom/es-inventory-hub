## 1. STORYBRAND COMPLIANCE ANALYSIS

### Current StoryBrand Performance: 7/10

#### What's Working Well

| StoryBrand Element | Current Strength |
|-------------------|------------------|
| **Customer as Hero** | ✅ Strong - Testimonials center on client experiences, not attorney ego |
| **Guide Positioning** | ✅ Good - "Compassionate Support" + expertise balance shows empathy + authority |
| **Testimonials** | ✅ Excellent - Video testimonials emphasize trust, relief, uniqueness |
| **Calls to Action** | ✅ Clear - "Schedule a Consult" is direct and prominent |
| **Success Stories** | ✅ Present - Client testimonials show transformation from stress to relief |

#### StoryBrand Gaps to Address

| Framework Element | Current Issue | Needed Improvement |
|------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Problem Statement** | Homepage doesn't explicitly name the villain upfront | Lead with: "Insurance company denied your claim? Delayed your payout?" |
| **Internal Problem** | Not clearly articulated | Add emotional language: "You feel powerless. Your insurance company should help, not fight you." |
| **3-Part Plan** | Process is vague ("Schedule a Consult") | Create clear steps: "1. Free Consultation 2. We Fight Your Insurer 3. You Get Paid" |
| **Failure Stakes** | Missing "what's at risk" messaging | Add urgency: "Most claims lose 40% of value without legal help" or "Statute of limitations is ticking" |
| **Philosophical Problem** | Weak on the "why this matters" | "You paid premiums for years. You deserve what you're owed." |
| **Transformation Vision** | Present but could be stronger | Paint clearer picture: "From denied claim to check in hand in 90 days" |
