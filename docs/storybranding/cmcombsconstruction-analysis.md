## 1. STORYBRAND COMPLIANCE ANALYSIS

### Current StoryBrand Performance: 5/10 (Estimated)

Based on available information, CM Combs has good foundational elements but significant opportunities for enhancement.

#### What's Working Well

| Element | Current Strength |
|---------|------------------|
| **Clear Differentiation** | ✅ "Hands-on, open-book approach" is specific and compelling |
| **Credible Authority** | ✅ Prestigious project portfolio (WWII Museum, Audubon) establishes credibility |
| **Preferred Contractor Status** | ✅ Public entity recognition provides third-party validation |
| **Service Clarity** | ✅ Design-build, construction management, commercial renovations clearly defined |

#### StoryBrand Gaps to Address

| Framework Element | Current Issue | Needed Fix |
|------------------|---------------|------------|
| **Hero (Customer)** | Likely company-centric messaging | Center on customer: "Your project timeline is tight. Your budget is firm. Your stakeholders are watching." |
| **Problem Statement** | Not explicitly articulated upfront | Lead with: "Construction projects go over budget, past deadline, and create endless headaches. Yours won't." |
| **Internal Problem** | Missing emotional connection | Add: "You're stressed about this project. You worry about delays. You fear budget overruns. You need certainty." |
| **Philosophical Problem** | Not clearly stated | "Major construction projects deserve transparent partners, not contractors who hide costs and miss deadlines" |
| **Guide Positioning** | Authority present but empathy could be stronger | Add: "For 14 years, we've delivered complex projects on time and on budget when others said it couldn't be done" |
| **Plan** | Not clearly visible/simple | Create 3-step plan: "1. Collaborative Planning 2. Transparent Execution 3. On-Time Delivery" |
| **Failure Stakes** | Not emphasized | "Budget overruns cost 20-40% more. Schedule delays cost $10K-$100K per month. Poor contractors risk your reputation." |
| **Success Vision** | Missing transformation | "Imagine: project completed on time, under budget, with zero surprises. That's the CM Combs difference." |

STEP 2: TRANSPARENT EXECUTION
Open-book pricing means you see every dollar. Daily communication means
you're never in the dark. Hands-on management means problems get solved
before they become crises.

STEP 3: ON-TIME DELIVERY
We hit deadlines because we plan realistically, communicate constantly,
and solve problems proactively. Your project opens when you need it to.

```

**5. Call to Action:**

**Direct CTA (Primary):**
- "Schedule Your Project Consultation" (prominent button)
- "Call Chris Combs: (985) 867-4960"
- "Request a Proposal"
- "Discuss Your Project"

**Transitional CTA (Secondary):**
- "See Our Portfolio: National WWII Museum, Audubon, Raymond James & More"
- "Download: The Owner's Guide to Design-Build Construction"
- "Read: Why Public Entities Choose CM Combs"
- "Watch: Inside Our Open-Book Process"
- "See: Client Testimonials by Project Type"

**6. Avoid Failure (Stakes):**

```
THE HIDDEN COST OF CHOOSING THE WRONG CONTRACTOR:

❌ Budget Overruns: Industry average is 20-40% over budget. On a $5M project,
   that's $1M-$2M in unexpected costs that destroy budgets and careers.

❌ Schedule Delays: Every month of delay costs $10K-$100K+ in carrying costs,
   lost revenue, and operational disruption. Some projects never recover.

❌ Quality Problems: Rework costs 5-10x more than doing it right the first time.
   Poor quality damages your organization's reputation for decades.

❌ Communication Breakdowns: Surprises late in construction force bad decisions
   under pressure. "We didn't know" isn't an acceptable explanation to boards.

❌ Contractor Conflicts: Design vs. construction finger-pointing delays solutions
   and adds legal costs. Single-source design-build eliminates this.

❌ Reputation Damage: Public project failures make news. Donor-funded overruns
   destroy trust. Corporate projects gone wrong end careers.

DON'T RISK IT. CHOOSE THE CONTRACTOR LOUISIANA'S MOST DEMANDING CLIENTS TRUST.
```

#### 4. Glossary / Definitions

Create `/resources/construction-glossary` with 100+ terms:

**Essential Construction Terms:**

- **Design-Build:** A project delivery method where a single entity holds contracts with the owner for both design and construction services, providing single-source accountability from concept to completion. Typically 30-40% faster than traditional delivery with better cost control.

- **CM-at-Risk (Construction Manager at Risk):** A delivery method where the construction manager acts as consultant to the owner during design, then holds the contracts with subcontractors during construction while guaranteeing a maximum price. Provides owner more control than design-build while still offering cost certainty.

- **Open-Book Construction:** A transparent approach where the contractor shares all project costs, subcontractor bids, invoices, and markup with the owner. Eliminates hidden costs and builds trust through complete financial transparency.

- **Value Engineering:** A systematic review of a project's design to identify opportunities to reduce costs while maintaining or improving function and quality. Most effective when done early in design phase of design-build projects.

- **GMP (Guaranteed Maximum Price):** A contract type where the contractor guarantees the project will not exceed a specific price. Owner benefits from any cost savings below GMP. Common in CM-at-Risk and some design-build contracts.

- **Louisiana Public Bid Law:** State law governing procurement of public construction projects. Requires competitive bidding for projects over certain thresholds, pre-qualification, bonding, prevailing wages, and other compliance requirements.

- **Substantial Completion:** The stage when a project is sufficiently complete that the owner can occupy or utilize it for its intended purpose, even if minor punch list items remain. Triggers warranty periods and final payment.

- **DBE/MBE/WBE (Disadvantaged/Minority/Women Business Enterprise):** Programs requiring certain percentages of public project work be awarded to certified disadvantaged, minority-owned, or women-owned businesses. Common requirement on public projects.

- **Prevailing Wage:** Minimum wage rates established by law for workers on public construction projects. Typically higher than private sector rates. Required on most Louisiana public projects.

- **Change Order:** A written modification to the construction contract documenting changes to scope, schedule, or cost. Requires owner approval. Transparent change order process is critical to avoiding disputes.

#### 6. Q&A Format Content

**Q: What is design-build construction and is it right for my project?**

A: Design-build is a project delivery method where a single entity—the design-build contractor—provides both design and construction services under one contract. Here's how it works and when it makes sense:

**How Design-Build Works:**

**Traditional (Design-Bid-Build) Process:**
1. Owner hires architect to design
2. Design completed without contractor input
3. Project bid to contractors
4. Often discover design is over budget or has constructability issues
5. Value engineering reduces quality or delays project
6. Construction proceeds with designer and contractor often in conflict

**Design-Build Process:**
1. Owner hires design-build team (architect + contractor together)
2. Design and budgeting happen simultaneously
3. Real-time cost feedback during design
4. Value engineering throughout (not just at the end)
5. Single team accountable for both design and construction
6. Collaborative problem-solving (not designer vs. contractor conflict)

**Benefits of Design-Build:**

**1. Faster Project Delivery (30-40% time savings)**
- Design and construction overlap
- No bid phase delay
- Streamlined decision-making
- Faster permitting (contractor involved early)

**Example:** A traditional $5M office building takes 24 months (6 months design, 3 months bid, 15 months construction). Design-build delivers in 16 months by overlapping phases.

**2. Better Cost Control**
- Real-time budget feedback during design
- No "design complete then discover it's over budget" surprise
- Value engineering throughout, not just at the end
- Single entity accountable for budget

**Example:** Traditional project designed to $5M budget comes in at $6.5M when bid (30% over). Design-build provides GMP early, avoiding this surprise.

**3. Single-Source Accountability**
- One contract, one point of responsibility
- No "designer blames contractor, contractor blames designer"
- Problems solved, not debated
- Owner has one throat to choke if things go wrong

**4. Fewer Changes and Conflicts**
- Integrated team prevents design vs. construction conflicts
- Constructability reviewed during design
- Reduces change orders by 50%+

**When Design-Build Makes Sense:**

**✅ Great For:**
- Fast-track projects with aggressive schedules
- Complex projects requiring design-construction collaboration
- Budget-sensitive projects needing cost certainty early
- Projects where owner values simplified management
- Renovations where existing conditions require flexibility
- Projects requiring specialized construction expertise during design

**❌ Maybe Not For:**
- Very simple projects where design is straightforward
- Projects where owner wants to control every design detail
- Situations where public procurement requires traditional bid
- Projects where lowest-bid price is the only consideration

**CM Combs Design-Build Approach:**

- Experienced architectural partners
