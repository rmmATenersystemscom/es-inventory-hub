# üîÑ CHECK-IN Process Documentation

## üö® **CRITICAL DIRECTIVE: When You Yell "CHECK-IN!"**

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**: When you type "CHECK-IN!" in the chat, the AI assistant MUST immediately execute the complete Git commit and versioning process described below. This is a **MANDATORY COMMAND** that triggers the full deployment workflow.

## **What "CHECK-IN!" Means:**
- **Trigger Command**: "CHECK-IN!" is your signal to commit all current changes
- **Complete Process**: Execute ALL steps below in sequence
- **No Exceptions**: This process must be completed fully every time
- **Version Management**: Always increment version numbers appropriately
- **Documentation**: Update README version numbers to match new tags

## **MANDATORY CHECK-IN Workflow (Execute in Order):**

### **Step 1: Pre-Check**
- **Check existing tags**: `git tag --sort=-version:refname | head -5`
- **Determine next version**: Based on change type (patch/minor/major)
- **Verify all changes**: Ensure all modifications are ready for commit

### **Step 2: Git Operations**
1. **Stage all changes**: `git add .`
2. **Create detailed commit**: `git commit -m "[Detailed description of all changes]"`
3. **Create version tag**: `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "[Comprehensive change description]"`
4. **Push everything**: `git push origin main --tags`

### **Step 3: README Version Updates**
- **Update Project Overview**: Change `**Current Version**: vX.Y.Z (stable)` to new version
- **Update Current Version Section**: Change `## üöÄ Current Version (vX.Y.Z)` to new version
- **Commit version update**: `git add README.md && git commit -m "Update version to vX.Y.Z" && git push`

### **Step 4: Confirmation**
- **Display completion message** with tag used and changes committed
- **List all modified files** and their purposes
- **Confirm successful push** to GitHub

## **Version Numbering Rules:**
- **Patch (vX.Y.Z+1)**: Bug fixes, minor improvements (v1.14.2 ‚Üí v1.14.3)
- **Minor (vX.Y+1.0)**: New features, dashboard additions (v1.14.2 ‚Üí v1.15.0)  
- **Major (vX+1.0.0)**: Breaking changes, architecture changes (v1.14.2 ‚Üí v2.0.0)

## **Required Output Format:**
```
CHECK-IN COMPLETE! ‚úÖ

Tag Used: vX.Y.Z

Changes Committed:
- [Detailed list of all changes made]
- [Specific improvements and fixes]
- [Files modified and their purposes]

Files Modified:
- [List of all changed files with descriptions]

The changes have been successfully committed and pushed to GitHub with tag vX.Y.Z
All detailed revision notes are preserved in Git tag messages and commit history
```

## **Example CHECK-IN Output**
```

All detailed revision notes are preserved in Git tag messages and commit history

## üê≥ RE-BUILD-DOCKERS! Process

### **When to Use RE-BUILD-DOCKERS!**
When you yell "RE-BUILD-DOCKERS!" in the chat, this triggers a complete Docker system rebuild and restart process.

### **What Happens During RE-BUILD-DOCKERS!**
1. **Stop All Services**: Docker Compose down and kill all related processes
2. **Clean Environment**: Purge unused Docker components and containers
3. **Rebuild Everything**: Docker Compose up with build flag
4. **Verify Deployment**: Check container status and health

**Note**: The `rebuild-dashboards.sh` script handles all these steps automatically.

### **RE-BUILD-DOCKERS! Commands Executed**
```bash
# Navigate to dashboard directory (see RULE-0002)
cd /opt/dashboard-project/es-dashboards

# Run the rebuild script
./rebuild-dashboards.sh
```

### **RE-BUILD-DOCKERS! Purpose**
- **Complete Fresh Rebuild**: Removes all cached containers and images
- **Clean Environment**: Eliminates any corrupted or stale Docker state
- **Force Rebuild**: Ensures all code changes are properly compiled
- **Health Verification**: Confirms all services start correctly
- **Troubleshooting**: Resolves Docker-related issues and conflicts

### **When to Use RE-BUILD-DOCKERS!**
- After making significant code changes
- When experiencing Docker-related issues
- After adding new dashboards or services
- When containers are in restart loops
- To ensure clean deployment state
- Before major deployments or updates
