## 1. STORYBRAND COMPLIANCE ANALYSIS

### Current StoryBrand Performance: 5/10 (Estimated)

#### What's Working

| Element | Current Strength |
|---------|------------------|
| **Service Clarity** | ✅ Clear service categories (managed IT, cybersecurity, cloud) |
| **Geographic Focus** | ✅ New Orleans metro area specificity |
| **Pricing Model** | ✅ Flat-rate pricing mentioned (predictable plan) |
| **Experience** | ✅ 25 years establishes authority |

#### StoryBrand Gaps (Critical Issues)

| Framework Element | Current Issue | Needed Fix |
|------------------|---------------|------------|
| **Hero (Customer)** | Unclear if messaging centers on customer or company | Lead with customer's story: "Your business can't afford downtime" |
| **Problem** | Not clearly articulated on homepage | State the villain explicitly: ransomware, system failures, costly downtime |
| **Guide** | "25 years experience" is good but needs empathy + authority | Add: "We've helped 500+ Louisiana businesses avoid costly IT disasters" |
| **Plan** | Service list exists but not simplified | Create 3-step plan: "1. Free Assessment 2. Custom IT Strategy 3. Ongoing Protection" |
| **Call to Action** | Likely generic "Contact Us" | **Direct:** "Schedule Your Free IT Security Assessment" **Transitional:** "Download: 10 IT Risks Killing Louisiana Businesses" |
| **Failure Stakes** | Not emphasized | "Without proper IT management: data breaches cost LA businesses $200K on average" |
| **Success Vision** | Missing transformation | "Imagine: Zero downtime. Bulletproof security. Predictable IT costs." |

**Common IT Terms for Business Owners:**

- **Managed IT Services:** A comprehensive approach where an external provider handles all IT operations for a flat monthly fee, including monitoring, maintenance, security, and support.

- **Ransomware:** Malicious software that locks your data and demands payment for release. Prevention costs less than paying ransoms (which average $200K+).

- **Cloud Computing:** Storing and accessing data/applications over the internet instead of on local servers, offering flexibility and disaster recovery benefits.

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Security requiring two or more verification methods (password + phone code), blocking 99.9% of automated attacks.

- **Firewall:** Network security system that monitors and controls incoming/outgoing traffic based on security rules, acting as a barrier between trusted and untrusted networks.

- "The True Cost of IT Downtime for Construction Companies"
- "Cyber Threats Facing Louisiana Businesses in 2025"

**Local Data to Include:**
- Average IT spend by industry in Louisiana
- Downtime costs by business size
- Cyber attack frequency in Gulf South
- Cloud adoption rates in New Orleans
- Technology budgets: managed vs. break-fix

#### 6. Q&A Format Content

Structure content to answer questions directly:

**Q: How much does managed IT cost for a 25-person construction company in New Orleans?**

A: For a 25-person construction company in the New Orleans area, managed IT services typically range from $3,000-$6,000 per month, or approximately $120-240 per user. This includes:
- 24/7 network monitoring and management
- Help desk support for all users
- Cybersecurity protection (firewall, antivirus, email filtering)
- Cloud backup and disaster recovery
- Software updates and patch management
- Strategic IT planning

The exact cost depends on your specific needs such as:
- Number of servers and workstations
- Mobile workforce requirements (field workers accessing systems)
- Industry software integrations (Procore, Sage, etc.)
- Compliance requirements (CMMC for government contracts)
- Current infrastructure condition

Most construction firms find this investment pays for itself through reduced downtime, eliminated surprise IT expenses, and improved productivity. On average, our construction clients report 40% cost savings compared to their previous break-fix IT approach.

[Each Q&A should be 150-300 words with specific, actionable information]
